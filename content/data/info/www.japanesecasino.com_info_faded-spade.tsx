  introduction: `
As a child, I loved playing with playing cards. With family and friends, and even alone.

I remember the cheap paper cards I used to play with back then would quickly get dog-eared or bent. The first time I used plastic cards, I was deeply impressed by their smooth feel, solid thickness, and ease of shuffling, even as a child.

How much attention have you paid to the quality of playing cards? 🤔

A few years ago, Tom Wheaton lost his job in sales marketing. Married with two children and a part-time poker player, Wheaton deeply pondered his future. Should he look for a new job, or start something of his own?

It's easy to imagine the difficult situation Wheaton was in, bearing the responsibility of providing for his family. In fact, Wheaton had an idea he had been nurturing for years: to launch a new brand of playing cards that would make a splash in the industry.

Through his years of marketing experience and his time spent playing poker, Wheaton had realized something. With the recent poker boom, the game itself, its players, and its intricate rules have captivated many through television programs, and poker itself has seen remarkable evolution. However, there was one thing that had not changed.

That's right, it was the cards. Wheaton was contemplating a new brand of cards, made with the latest designs and high-quality, durable plastic. "I always had ideas about cards in my head, but it was a big gamble, for better or for worse. But I decided to go all-in on that gamble."

We see similar posts on Twitter and Facebook.

*   Matt: "Got dealt three 'marked' cards in the first 45 minutes of the WSOP. Totally careless."
*   Mike: "The WSOP 2017 cards were completely worn out after one round and all 'marked.' The cards are free, so they probably don't care about the players."
*   John: "Cards should never be a problem for the players."
*   Daniel: "The cards at this WSOP table are almost all 'marked.' I wish they would use better cards."

As you can see, there are quite a few complaints about card quality. It's natural for players who are dealt marked cards not to feel good about it. Wheaton focused strongly on this point.

With his sales and marketing experience, as well as connections in the poker industry through previous corporate partnerships and friends, Wheaton reached out to contacts and players he met at the World Poker Tour (WPT) and received valuable opinions and advice from them.

And that became a great force in realizing Wheaton's idea as the new card brand [Faded Spade](LINK_NEEDS_REPAIR).

David Gitter, Vice President of Marketing for the World Poker Tour, was one of those who connected with Wheaton. </>Everyone in the poker community wants players to have the best. Therefore, the idea of a new brand of high-quality cards felt truly innovative," he said, and the World Poker Tour has since designated Faded Spade as "The WPT Recommended Card."

"We believe Faded Spade represents the highest quality cards on the market. We look forward to seeing Faded Spade cards on the final tables of WPT Main Tour events and are proud to make Faded Spade our recommended card for the World Poker Tour," stated Adam Pliska, CEO of the World Poker Tour.

After developing the brand through research, investigation, and consultation with the WPT and professional poker players, Wheaton's dream was becoming increasingly realistic. At a time when there was active discussion about card quality at major poker events, Wheaton entered the field at precisely the right moment.

Wheaton wanted cards that could be handled smoothly, maintaining their shape and quality, both after shuffling and during play, under any circumstances.

One of the first poker pros to show strong interest and provide feedback on card quality was Daniel Weinman. A former WPT Champion, he described the design of the Faded Spade cards as "fresh and fun" upon first seeing them and commented that they were of superior quality to other top brands he had used.

"Isn't it time the poker industry considered some changes? Because imperfect cards can certainly contribute to problems during play," he added.
