- **Fees and Processing Times for Japanese Players**

  The Research provides insight into wagering requirements (30x–40x), maximum cashout limits, and bonuses with no wagering, advising on pitfalls in bonus usage. The Original shows some wagering numbers but lacks a broader contextual explanation for Japanese players on how these terms impact their experience.
