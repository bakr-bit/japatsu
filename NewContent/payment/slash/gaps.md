- **JPY Support and Currency Conversion**  
  Original lacks any mention that Slash Payment does not directly process Japanese Yen (JPY) and requires currency conversion through exchanges. Research clarifies that transactions involve conversion as Slash Payment supports only cryptocurrencies.

- **Withdrawal Support and Limits**  
  Original states Slash Payment is currently deposit-only with no withdrawal support but lacks details on typical deposit and withdrawal limits or variability by platform. Research mentions that limits generally exist based on equivalent major currency values, which is missing.

- **KYC and Verification Requirements**  
  Original only says KYC is not required for Slash Payment, but Research explains that users usually must comply with KYC/verification aligned with cryptocurrency exchange practices, which is an important regulatory nuance absent in Original.

- **Processing Times**  
  Original gives "instant" or immediate deposit time, but Research notes that crypto transactions can take minutes to hours depending on network congestion, providing a more nuanced and realistic expectation.

- **Fee Details and Variability**  
  Original mentions no fees except network fees and possible high smart contract fees but lacks mention that fees can vary significantly depending on network conditions (e.g., blockchain congestion), a nuance emphasized by Research.

- **Security and Regulatory Compliance in Japan**  
  Original barely covers security beyond technical usage details; Research outlines the stringent Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA) regulatory framework requiring AML compliance and registration for crypto payment services and gambling platforms, important for legal use and user protection.

- **User Issues and Support in Japan**  
  Original lists some QR code and smartphone scanning issues but lacks broader discussion from Research about user challenges related to network delays, technical glitches, and the resolution process via customer support.

- **Market Adoption and Alternative Crypto Payment Methods**  
  Original notes only Konibet as a supported platform with limited adoption but does not contextualize market penetration or compare Slash Payment to other more widely used crypto payment options like Bitcoin or Ethereum payments emphasized in Research.

- **Tax Considerations and Legal Status**  
  Original omits any discussion of tax or legal considerations specific to Japan, while Research indirectly references compliance needs under Japanese law, which can impact usage and reporting requirements.

- **Availability Beyond Konibet and Future Outlook**  
  Original mentions only Konibet integration and hints at future expansion without details. Research acknowledges limited current adoption and forecasts possible growth with expanded platform support, underlining ongoing market development.
