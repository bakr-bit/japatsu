- **Operational Status Update (2024)**: The Original mentions Point66 service ended but lacks a clear, explicit update that as of 2024, Point66 is fully discontinued and unusable. The Research stresses service cessation impacting all affiliated casinos and players must find alternatives.  
  *Rationale*: Critical for Japanese players to know Point66 is obsolete now, not just "ended"—Research states "Point66 payment method has officially ceased operations."  

- **Deposit/Withdrawal Process Post-Closure**: Original still describes detailed procedures for deposits, withdrawals, and account registration with Point66. Research clarifies no deposit/withdrawal processes exist currently for Japanese users as the service is defunct.  
  *Rationale*: Original's instructions can mislead users into attempting to use non-functional services.  

- **Fees and Currency Exchange Information**: Original provides detailed fee tables and currency exchange notes for Point66 transactions. Research states that since the service is discontinued, no such fees or currency exchanges currently apply at all.  
  *Rationale*: Prevents confusion about paying fees for an inactive service.

- **Availability and Compatibility at Japanese Online Casinos**: Original lists some casinos supporting Point66 as of 2023, but research notes that due to service closure these are no longer available, and Japanese-facing casinos are transitioning to alternatives like Payz, iWallet, credit cards, and bank transfers.  
  *Rationale*: Enables Japanese players to understand current casino payment options and plan accordingly.

- **Legal/Compliance Status**: Research highlights that with Point66’s discontinuation, legal and compliance issues related to it no longer apply; players and casinos should ensure new methods meet Japanese regulations. Original does not mention this compliance update.  
  *Rationale*: Important for Japanese users concerned about lawful transactions and gambling regulations.

- **Security and Reliability Comparison**: Research emphasizes Point66 was formerly reliable and secure but users must now rely on alternatives with strong fraud protection (credit cards, bank transfers). Original lacks any discussion on security or reliability relative to other methods.  
  *Rationale*: Helps Japanese users weigh payment options’ safety after Point66 closure.

- **Guidance Toward Alternative Payment Methods for Japanese Users**: Research explicitly recommends exploring substitutes such as Payz, credit cards, and traditional banking, reflecting current real-world options post-Point66. Original does not present recommendations or guidance for Japanese users aside from a brief mention of other methods.  
  *Rationale*: Facilitates smooth transition for Japanese players to valid payment services.

In summary, the Original is outdated and retains operational details no longer valid in 2024; it misses clear, Japan-relevant updates on Point66 discontinuation, legal compliance changes, loss of usability, plus lacks security comparisons and alternative payment guidance emphasized in the Research.
