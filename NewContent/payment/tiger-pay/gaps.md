- **JPY (Japanese Yen) Support & Currency Conversion Issues**  
  Original lacks mention that Tiger Pay does not support JPY directly, requiring currency conversion that can incur additional fees. This is crucial for Japanese users who expect JPY-based transactions. (Research: "Tiger Pay... does not directly support the Japanese Yen (JPY), requiring players to undergo currency conversion...")

- **Detailed Account Types & KYC Process**  
  Research clearly differentiates between Fast Account (email-only, limited features) and Personal Account (full KYC verification needed). Original touches on this but less explicitly explains the upgrade process and implications for withdrawal functionality. (Research: "Fast Account: Limited to cryptocurrencies... Personal Account: Requires thorough KYC...")

- **Transaction Limits Impacting High Rollers**  
  The Research highlights that ATM withdrawal limits ($3,000 per transaction, $10,000 monthly) may be restrictive for high rollers. While Original mentions limits, it does not emphasize the high roller impact specifically. (Research: "Limits Impacting High Rollers...")

- **Processing Times (Deposits, Withdrawals, Card Loading)**  
  Research specifies deposits and withdrawals are typically swift, usually within hours, while Original mentions card charge delays (3–5 business days) but lacks exact withdrawal processing time context. (Research: "Typically swift, but can vary...")

- **Fee Structure, Including Currency Exchange and Bank Transfer Fees**  
  Research gives a clearer breakdown: about 5% bank transfer fees, additional currency exchange fees, noting these fees are higher compared to alternatives. Original vaguely mentions fees but does not detail currency exchange fees or compare to other methods as clearly. (Research: "Typical bank transfer fee is around 5%... currency conversion incurs additional fees...")

- **Legal/Compliance Challenges in Japan**  
  Research points out Tiger Pay’s alignment with international regulations but challenges with Japanese specific licensing, which is not discussed in Original. This affects trust and usability perception among Japanese users. (Research: "Tiger Pay aligns with international payment regulations but faces challenges with Japanese laws...")

- **Security and Reliability Details**  
  Research explicitly notes standard encryption and fraud detection measures, and comments on overall reliability. Original mentions the corporate licensing but less on technical security measures or reliability experience. (Research: "Tiger Pay appears secure, incorporating standard encryption and fraud detection.")

- **Alternatives and Market Positioning in Japan**  
  Research discusses alternatives favored by Japanese players (crypto solutions, other prepaid cards with better JPY support), highlighting Tiger Pay’s competitive disadvantages. Original only briefly mentions Payz and legacy wallets, no real market comparison. (Research: "Other payment methods popular among Japanese players include cryptocurrency solutions and competitors with better JPY handling.")

- **User Satisfaction and Adoption Data**  
  Research notes scarcity of authoritative user satisfaction figures and mixed feedback due to financial/regulatory issues; Original does not address user satisfaction or market adoption data at all. (Research: "User feedback suggests mixed sentiments due to financial and regulatory nuances...")

In sum, Original underdevelops critical Japan-specific details on currency support and fees, KYC/account types, processing times, compliance challenges, security assurances, and competitive positioning that Research clearly highlights.
