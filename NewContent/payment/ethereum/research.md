### Verification and KYC

Regulations mandate thorough Know Your Customer (KYC) processes for users, integrating identity verification with Ethereum transactions. This ensures compliance with anti-money laundering laws and enhances security.

## Exchange Rates and Conversion

Ethereum transactions involve converting ETH to JPY:

### Competitive Landscape

Ethereum is among several cryptocurrencies accepted:
- **Alternatives**: Bitcoin, Ripple, and Litecoin are frequently used, each with varying levels of compliance and player experience.
- **User Experience**: Alternative cryptocurrencies might offer differing transaction speeds and fees, influencing player choice.

## Legal and Regulatory Considerations

Cryptocurrency usage in Japan is regulated:
