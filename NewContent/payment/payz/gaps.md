- **JPY Currency Support**
  - Research states Payz supports Japanese Yen (JPY) transactions, easing currency conversion and minimizing fees for Japanese users.
  - Original does not mention JPY support explicitly, even though it mentions "about 50 currencies" and lists USD/EUR cards, but notes JPY is not supported for cards. (Research: "Payz supports multiple currencies including JPY"; Original: "日本円は非対応" for cards)

- **Bank Accounts and Payment Methods in Japan**
  - Research details linking Japanese bank accounts and credit/debit cards for deposits and withdrawals via Payz.
  - Original lacks specifics on how Japanese users fund their Payz accounts (e.g., Japanese bank transfers, card acceptance) and alternative methods (crypto mentioned only briefly elsewhere but not for Payz).

- **KYC and Verification Procedures**
  - Research explicitly explains KYC requirements for Japanese users (passport, proof of address) to increase limits and access withdrawals.
  - Original does not cover KYC or identity verification requirements at all.

- **Fee Structures for Japanese Users**
  - Research highlights specific fees from Japanese banks funding Payz accounts (percentages, flat fees), plus both sending and receiving fees, and exchange rate margins.
  - Original provides a fee table but lacks explicit explanation focused on Japan-specific fees or examples from Japanese banks; does not clarify sending vs receiving fees or how currency conversion impacts fees from a Japan angle.

- **Exchange Rates and Currency Conversion Costs**
  - Research mentions Payz charges currency conversion rates above mid-market rates which affect Japanese users.
  - Original only gives an overall currency conversion fee but lacks discussion of impact from JPY conversions or how exchange rates affect Japanese users specifically.

- **Transaction Limits**
  - Research discusses minimum/maximum deposit and withdrawal limits dependent on verification status for Japanese accounts.
  - Original does not mention transaction limits or how they vary with account status.

- **Processing Times for Deposits and Withdrawals**
  - Research specifies deposits are usually instant and withdrawals can take 1-3 days depending on casino rules.
  - Original only states "基本的に即時反映" (usually instant), which is shallower detail compared to research.

- **Acceptance and Availability among Japanese Online Casinos**
  - Research notes Payz acceptance varies by casino; it is popular but some smaller casinos may not support it.
  - Original lists some casinos but does not discuss market penetration or availability nuances in Japan.

- **Regulatory and Legal Compliance in Japan**
  - Research covers Japan’s regulatory environment impacting online gambling payments and notes no significant restrictions on Payz as of 2025.
  - Original omits any legal or compliance context relevant to Japan.

- **Security Features Relevant to Japanese Users**
  - Research highlights two-factor authentication, PCI compliance, data encryption, and regulation by Cyprus authorities.
  - Original mentions 2FA and recent security measures but does not tie these explicitly to regulatory compliance or broader fraud protection context for Japan.

- **Comparison with Competing E-Wallets Popular in Japan**
  - Research compares Payz to PayPal and Skrill with Japan user considerations.
  - Original misses any competitor comparison, which could aid Japanese users in deciding.

- **Tax Implications**
  - Research mentions Japanese users should be aware of tax issues related to gambling winnings and electronic transactions.
  - Original does not address tax or reporting implications at all.

In summary, the Original mostly lacks Japan-specific details on JPY currency support, bank/payment method integration, KYC verification, detailed fees and exchange rates in a Japanese context, transaction limits, precise processing times, regulatory environment, and competitor comparison—all important for Japanese online casino users managing Payz accounts.
