- **JPY Support and Currency Exchange Fees**: The Original lacks detailed information on whether casinos support deposits in Japanese Yen (JPY), currency exchange fees, or mention that many casinos accept JPY to minimize conversion costs. (Research: "many casinos supporting JCB allow for JPY transactions, minimizing conversion fees")

- **Withdrawal Procedures and Limitations**: Although the Original mentions no withdrawals via JCB cards, it does not explain the typical withdrawal workflow involving alternative methods like bank transfers or e-wallets, nor the KYC processes required before withdrawals. (Research: "JCB does not support direct cashouts...players use bank transfers or e-wallets," and "KYC and verification steps involving ID documents")

- **Minimum Deposit Amounts and Limits**: The Original provides some minimum deposit values but lacks a comprehensive overview with standardized ranges (e.g., 1,000 to 5,000 JPY), as well as mention of deposit limits from casinos or card issuers. (Research: "Minimum deposit amounts may vary...typically 1,000 to 5,000 JPY")

- **Processing Times for Deposits and Withdrawals**: The Original is vague on transaction speeds; the Research states that deposits via JCB are generally instant, while withdrawal timings depend on alternative methods. (Research: "processing times for deposits are generally instant")

- **Security Features – J/Secure Two-Step Authentication**: The Original mentions "Jセキュア" briefly but does not fully explain it as a two-factor authentication system that enhances fraud protection, which is emphasized in the Research. (Research: "JCB implements robust security measures, including 'J/Secure,' a two-step authentication process")

- **Regulatory and Compliance Environment in Japan**: The Original does not cover the legal/regulatory context around gambling in Japan, nor the implications for using JCB cards at international casinos with licenses abroad. (Research: "In Japan, online gambling is a gray area...some casinos operate under international licenses posing regulatory challenges")

- **Comparison of JCB with Other Payment Methods in Terms of Acceptance and Support**: The Original favors JCB from a Japanese brand perspective but omits a fuller comparison including international acceptance and withdrawal options of VISA, Mastercard, and e-wallets noted in the Research. (Research: "international methods may offer broader acceptance and withdrawal options")

- **Future Developments in JCB Online Casino Payments**: The Original does not mention any ongoing or upcoming initiatives by JCB to improve online casino payment experience, promotional efforts, or feature expansions noted in the Research. (Research: "JCB interest in expanding reach, promotions, reduced fees, and enhanced verification")

- **Specifics on Fees and Transaction Costs**: The Original lists some casino-specific fees but does not give a consolidated overview of potential JCB-related fees or comparative transaction costs versus other cards or e-wallets. (Research: "JCB sometimes offers competitive transaction fees compared to VISA/Mastercard")

- **Detailed KYC and Verification Steps**: While the Original mentions personal authentication like 3D Secure, it omits explicit details on KYC document types or timing relative to deposits/withdrawals as found in the Research.

- **Japanese Banks or E-wallet Integration Details**: The Original mentions e-wallets as alternatives but lacks depth on their integration with JCB transactions or their importance for withdrawals. (Research discusses reliance on e-wallets/bank transfers for withdrawals given JCB limitations)
