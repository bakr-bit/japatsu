- **Japanese Online Platform Support & JPY Transactions**  
  - Research details the existence of international poker platforms (e.g., PokerStars, GGPoker) offering Japanese language support and JPY currency transactions. The Original lacks any mention of these platforms’ language or currency features, or their availability and status for the Japanese market.  
  *(Research section: "Japanese Online Platforms for Six-Plus Poker")*

- **Regulatory and Legal Environment in Japan**  
  - Research explicitly mentions that online poker in Japan is in a regulatory gray area, neither clearly legal nor illegal, advising players to stay informed about evolving laws and terms of service. The Original does not address Japan’s legal or compliance context regarding online poker.  
  *(Research section: "Regulatory Environment in Japan")*

- **Responsible Gambling Resources in Japan**  
  - Research notes that Japanese online poker platforms often provide responsible gambling tools like self-exclusion and financial management, encouraging safe play. The Original only lists “責任あるプレイ” links without elaboration on Japan-specific gambling responsibility support or resources.  
  *(Research section: "Responsible Gambling and Resources")*

- **Strategic Play Considerations Specific to Japanese Players**  
  - While the Original focuses heavily on rules and gameplay, Research adds strategic advice adapted to Six-Plus Poker’s altered probabilities and promotes an aggressive style taking account of the smaller deck. This strategic depth relevant to Japanese players is underdeveloped in the Original.

- **Fees, Processing Times, KYC and Security on Japanese Platforms**  
  - Research implicitly suggests that platforms serving Japanese players handle KYC, security, and possibly fees, but Original contains no details on transactional or account security practices for the Japan market.  

- **Taxation on Winnings for Japanese Players**  
  - Research does not directly elaborate on taxes but implies players should understand legal and financial implications; Original omits any mention of tax implications on poker winnings in Japan.

Summary: The Original is detailed on gameplay rules and casino options but lacks critical Japan-relevant info on platform language/JPY support, legal/regulatory context, responsible gambling resources, strategic insights suitable for Japanese players, and operational details such as KYC/security/fees and tax considerations highlighted in the Research.
