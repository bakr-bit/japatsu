- **JPY Currency Support and Deposits/Withdrawals**:  
  The Research explicitly mentions that many reputable online casinos accept Japanese Yen (JPY) for transactions, which is missing from the Original. This is critical for Japanese players to avoid currency conversion fees and simplify bankroll management. ("Currency Handling": The majority of reputable casinos allow transactions in Japanese Yen (JPY))

- **Japanese Language Support in Casinos**:  
  The Research highlights that many international casinos offer Japanese interfaces to cater to local users, an important usability factor not covered or mentioned in the Original.

- **Mobile and Live Dealer Options**:  
  Although the Original mentions that some casinos offer live dealer versions, it lacks detail on mobile compatibility and the quality of live dealer experiences emphasized in the Research as enhancing user experience for Japanese players.

- **Licensing and Regulatory Compliance**:  
  The Research discusses the importance of playing on platforms licensed by respected jurisdictions such as Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) or UK Gambling Commission (UKGC), ensuring fairness and trustworthiness. The Original does not address legal status, licensing, or regulatory compliance—which is crucial given Japan’s complex online gambling laws. ("Platform Reliability and Trustworthiness": licenses from MGA or UKGC)

- **Legal and Regulatory Landscape for Japanese Players**:  
  The Research provides important context about Japan’s gambling regulations and the legal grey area for offshore online casinos. This helps Japanese players navigate risks but is absent from the Original.

- **House Edge and RTP Statistics**:  
  The Research specifies house edge percentages for Ante/Play (~3.37%) and Pair Plus (~2.32%), and discusses volatility and hit frequencies (~25-30% for Pair Plus). The Original mentions house edge only generally ("2~4%") without quantitative detail.

- **Security and Fairness Assurance**:  
  Through discussion of licensing and regulation, the Research implies security and compliance measures to protect players. The Original lacks any commentary on player protection, data security, or fairness guarantees.

- **Tax Implications and Player Considerations**:  
  While the Research does not detail taxes explicitly, it emphasizes legal/regulatory compliance that can affect legal and tax status of winnings for Japanese players. The Original omits any mention of tax or legal implications of online gambling winnings.

- **Processing Times and Fees**:  
  The Research implies currency handling and licensed sites may reduce fees and withdrawal times, but the Original has no information about deposit/withdrawal processing times or potential fees relevant to Japanese users.

- **Strategy Based on Statistical Probabilities**:  
  The Research states the recommended strategy clearly (play with Queen-6-4 or better), linking back to winning probabilities and RTP, while the Original mentions this briefly but not in the context of probabilities or house edge details.

In sum, the Original lacks Japan-specific details on currency support, language, licensing/legal compliance, detailed house edge/statistics, security assurances, and practical implications like fees and processing times—all extensively covered or implied in the Research.
