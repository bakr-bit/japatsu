- **JPY Currency Support and Payment Methods**:  
  The Original lacks any mention of JPY deposit/withdrawal support or details on Japanese banks and e-wallets payment options, which are critical for Japanese users. The Research notes many Japanese players rely on platforms allowing JPY deposits, often offshore due to Japan's gaming laws (Research: "Casinos allowing JPY deposits...", "Platforms Offering Poker").

- **Legal and Regulatory Information Specific to Japan**:  
  The Original does not address Japan's strict gambling laws or mention the absence of domestic online poker licensing. The Research elaborates on the regulatory environment, highlighting legal ambiguities and the necessity for Japanese players to use offshore sites (Research: "Japan’s gambling laws impose strict regulations...", "Licensing and Compliance").

- **Availability and Popularity Insights in Japan**:  
  While the Original lists poker variants, it does not discuss their relative popularity or trends specifically in Japan (e.g., Texas Hold'em and video poker as most popular, rise of live dealer formats). The Research provides these insights (Research: "Popularity Trends", "Live Dealer Poker gaining traction in Japan").

- **Fees, House Edge, and RTP in Detail**:  
  The Original includes some house edge data in a brief table but does not contextualize it fully, e.g., discussing player skill impact or house edge differences among variants. The Research discusses house edge variations and player volatility comprehensively (Research: "Poker variants differ significantly in house edge...", "Texas Hold'em generally offers low house edge...").

- **Processing Times for Deposits/Withdrawals**:  
  The Original omits any mention of deposit or withdrawal processing times relevant to Japanese users. The Research does not explicitly state times either, but notes accessibility via payment methods important to Japanese players (implying relevance).

- **KYC Procedures and Compliance on Platforms**:  
  The Original does not cover Know Your Customer (KYC) policies or compliance requirements on poker platforms. The Research outlines licensing/compliance implications and regulatory adherence necessary for player security and legal conformity (Research: "Licensing and Compliance", "Consumer Protections").

- **Security and Responsible Gambling Measures**:  
  The Original only briefly mentions "responsible play" without detail, while the Research details specific security measures such as encryption, fairness protocols, and dispute resolutions important for Japanese players' trust (Research: "Security Measures", "Consumer Protections").

- **Taxation Considerations for Japanese Players**:  
  No mention exists in the Original about tax implications of online poker winnings; the Research does not explicitly discuss taxation but notes the regulatory environment's impact—which implies taxation considerations for Japanese players.

- **Software Providers and Platform Quality Relevant to Japan**:  
  The Original lists casinos but does not mention software providers or differences in user experience. The Research identifies dominant platforms like PokerStars and 888poker with strong reputations, crucial for Japanese players choosing poker sites (Research: "Software and Providers", "User Experience").

- **Emerging Trends and New Game Variants Popular in Japan**:  
  The Original covers seven main variants but misses mention of newer or niche games like "short-deck hold'em," which the Research notes as emerging to attract diverse players (Research: "Emerging Variants"). Also, the Original lacks mention of live dealer poker’s growing presence in Japan (Research: "Live Dealer Poker gaining traction").
