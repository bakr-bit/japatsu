- **JPY Currency Support and Payment Methods**  
  The Original lacks any mention of whether Caribbean Stud Poker or the listed casinos support Japanese yen deposits/withdrawals, or detail payment methods popular in Japan such as Japanese banks, credit cards, or e-wallets.  
  *Research reference:* "Leading platforms offer transactions in JPY, making deposits and withdrawals simple for Japanese players." / "Some sites may restrict credit card use, encouraging e-wallet transactions."

- **Bonuses and Promotions Specific to Caribbean Stud Poker**  
  The Original does not discuss any bonuses or promotions tailored specifically to Caribbean Stud Poker players, unlike the Research which notes "welcome bonuses and promotions tailored to Caribbean Stud, enhancing their bankroll."

- **Platform Compatibility (Live Dealer vs RNG)**  
  The Original only generally references "ライブカジノ・バージョン、ランダムマシンゲーム," but does not clarify that Caribbean Stud Poker is available in both live dealer and RNG versions, nor explain the player experience differences.  
  *Research:* "The game is available in both live dealer and RNG formats, providing options for a more interactive or fast-paced experience."

- **Processing Times, Fees, and KYC Requirements**  
  The Original does not mention withdrawal/deposit processing times, fee structures, or KYC (identity verification) procedures common on Japanese-targeted casinos.  
  *Research* implies compliance and responsible gaming features but lacks specific times/fees; however, this is a notable omission in Original given the Japan-focus.

- **Legal and Regulatory Compliance for Japanese Players**  
  The Original does not address the legal status or regulatory environment of online gambling for Japanese players, including licensure of casinos or the legal "gray area" offshore sites occupy.  
  *Research:* Discusses "Reputable sites hold licenses from jurisdictions like Malta or Gibraltar" and the "complex legal landscape" in Japan.

- **Responsible Gaming Features**  
  While the Original has brief mentions of "責任あるプレイ," it omits detail on features such as deposit limits or self-exclusion which the Research highlights as important for compliance and player safety.

- **Odds, House Edge, and Strategic Considerations**  
  The Original provides basic payout tables but lacks any detail on odds, variance, or house edge (~5.22%), which are important for players to understand risk and reward, especially in Japan’s cautious gaming market.  
  *Research:* Provides "house edge," "hit frequency," and variance discussion.

- **Comparison with Other Poker Variants**  
  The Original does not compare Caribbean Stud Poker with other variants popular in Japan, such as Three Card Poker or Texas Hold'em Bonus, which Research does for context.

- **Recent Technological Developments and User Experience Tailoring for Japanese Market**  
  The Original does not mention recent trends like improved graphics, live dealer enhancements, or user interface tweaks aimed at Japanese players noted in Research ("trends indicate... improvements tailored for Japanese audiences").

- **Tax Implications**  
  Neither original nor research mention taxes, but given Research’s focus on legal/compliance, the omission suggests Original has no coverage of tax treatment of online gambling winnings in Japan.
