# Guide to Playing Caribbean Stud Poker for Japanese Online Casino Players

## Introduction to Caribbean Stud Poker

Caribbean Stud Poker is a casino table game derived from five-card stud poker, offering a unique blend of poker strategy and casino dynamics. It originated in the early 1980s, reportedly on a cruise ship in the Caribbean. Unlike traditional poker variants where players compete against each other, Caribbean Stud players compete against the dealer, simplifying the game for those unfamiliar with poker's complex player interactions.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Placing Bets:**
   - Begin by placing an ante bet.
   - Optional side bets, such as progressive jackpots, may also be placed at this time.

2. **The Deal:**
   - Each player receives five cards face down.
   - The dealer receives five cards, one face-up and four face-down.

3. **Player Decisions:**
   - After assessing their hand and the dealer's face-up card, players decide to fold or raise.
   - Folding forfeits the ante, while raising requires a bet typically double the ante.

4. **Dealer Qualification:**
   - The dealer must have at least an Ace-King high card to qualify.
   - If the dealer doesn't qualify, ante bets are paid even money, and raise bets push.

5. **Resolution:**
   - If the dealer qualifies, hands are compared.
   - Winning hands receive even money on the ante and raise bets, with additional payouts for strong hands based on a paytable.

With simple rules and lucrative payout possibilities, it's best enjoyed on platforms compliant with Japanese preferences and regulations. While not as deep in strategy as some poker variants, its appeal lies in direct competition with the house and the allure of substantial side bets.
