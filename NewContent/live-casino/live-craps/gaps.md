- **JPY Currency Support and Payment Methods**  
  The Original lacks detailed information on deposit and withdrawal options supporting Japanese Yen (JPY) and payment methods popular in Japan, such as Rakuten Pay and PayPal. The Research highlights that Japanese players benefit from tailored payment options including credit cards, bank transfers, and modern e-wallets with quick processing times (few hours to 3 business days) and competitive limits. (Research section: "Deposit and Withdrawal for Japanese Players")

- **Fees and Processing Times**  
  The Original does not mention fees or the typical processing times for deposits and withdrawals pertinent to Japanese users, which the Research specifies as generally quick and accommodating various stake sizes. (Research section: "Deposit and Withdrawal for Japanese Players")

- **Legal Compliance and Licensing Specific to Japanese Market**  
  There is no coverage in the Original about regulatory compliance or licensing. The Research notes Japanese-facing casinos generally hold licenses from recognized international bodies (Malta Gaming Authority, UK Gambling Commission), ensuring fair play and player protection. This is vital for Japanese players’ trust and legal assurance. (Research section: "Compliance for Japanese Market")

- **Promotions and Bonuses Tailored for Japanese Players**  
  Although the Original mentions bonuses broadly, it lacks specifics about dedicated welcome bonuses or live-game promotions designed especially for Japanese players, including typical wagering requirements (30x-40x). The Research emphasizes such incentives as crucial to attracting and retaining Japanese customers. (Research section: "Incentives for Japanese Players")

- **Japanese Language Support and Localization**  
  The Original briefly mentions chat functions and notes most dealers are non-Japanese, implying limited localization. The Research provides deeper insight on localized interfaces and Japanese-speaking dealers offered increasingly by Japanese casinos, improving accessibility and engagement for Japanese players. (Research section: "Integration of Social and Interactive Features")

- **Security and Fairness via Licensing**  
  While the Original does not address security measures, the Research highlights that proper licensing from authorities like MGA or UKGC assures game fairness and player fund security, which is especially relevant for Japanese players cautious about online gambling safety. (Research section: "Compliance for Japanese Market")

- **Return to Player (RTP) and House Edge Specifics Relevant to Japan**  
  The Original states RTP and house edge ranges mainly citing Evolution but without precise numbers or the context of what that implies for Japanese players. The Research gives clearer RTP benchmarks (e.g., 98.64% on Pass Line bet) and explains low house edge (1.36%), helping Japanese players understand their expected odds better. (Research section: "Return to Player (RTP) and House Edge")

- **Comparison of Live Craps Popularity and Player Experience in Japan**  
  The Original describes live craps popularity mainly from a gameplay perspective but does not contextualize it compared to other live table games in Japan. The Research notes that despite blackjack and roulette’s broader recognition, live craps retains a loyal Japanese player base due to its strategic depth and social gameplay. (Research section: "Popularity and Player Experience")

- **Technological Advances Impacting Japanese Players**  
  The Original mentions mechanical dice shooters and chat but does not fully develop how these technological features, plus HD streaming and interactive interfaces, enhance the Japanese player experience. The Research positions these advancements as key for immersion and realism desired by Japanese users. (Research section: "Technological Advancements")

In summary, the Original underdevelops Japan-specific financial transactional details (JPY support, payment methods, fees, processing times), regulatory/licensing and security assurances, tailored promotions with wagering requirements, Japanese language/localization efforts including Japanese dealers, specific RTP and house edge data, comparative popularity insights, and technological advancements enhancing player experience—all of which are clearly covered in the Research.
