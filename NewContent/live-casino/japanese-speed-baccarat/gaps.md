- **JPY Support & Payment Methods**  
  Research notes that Pragmatic Play is accessible on major platforms supporting multi-currency, including Japanese Yen (JPY), facilitating easy deposits and withdrawals for Japanese players. The Original does not mention JPY compatibility, supported Japanese banks, e-wallets, or details on payment availability. (Research: "Pragmatic Play is generally accessible through major platforms that support multi-currency transaction options, including Japanese Yen (JPY)")

- **Availability in Japanese Casinos & Licensing**  
  Research highlights the need for Japanese players to verify the licensing and regulatory compliance of online casinos hosting the game for consumer protection. The Original lists some casinos (Eldoah, Casitabi, Mystino) but does not discuss regulatory/licensing statuses, legal compliance, or whether these comply with Japanese jurisdiction. (Research: "Players should verify the licensing status of the casino hosting the game to ensure compliance and consumer protection")

- **Legal and Compliance Information**  
  Research clearly states that Pragmatic Play follows stringent global compliance standards and that there are no explicit Japanese legal restrictions for players, though licensing requirements affect casinos. This legal/compliance context is missing in the Original. (Research: "Pragmatic Play operates under stringent compliance aligned with global regulatory standards...Players should verify licensing")

- **Processing Times, Fees, and Commission Structures**  
  While the Original discusses the in-game commission rules (e.g., 5% on Banker bets in normal mode, 50% commission on Banker 6 in No Commission mode), it does not contextualize these in overall processing fees or payout delays for deposits/withdrawals. Research compares commission complexity with competitors and implies impacts on payout strategies but does not give direct details on withdrawal processing times or fees; however, this broader financial processing context is absent in the Original.

- **Security and Fairness Certifications**  
  Research emphasizes Pragmatic Play's certifications from reputable global regulators (Malta, UK) ensuring fairness and game integrity. The Original does not mention fairness certifications, security, or auditing of the game’s RNG or live dealer fairness. (Research: "Pragmatic Play is noted for its adherence to high ethical standards...certified by reliable global regulators such as those in Malta and the UK")

- **Customer Support and Japanese Language Accessibility**  
  Research indicates that Japanese players generally have access to comprehensive Japanese-language customer support on platforms hosting Pragmatic Play games, enhancing usability. The Original lacks any mention of customer support availability or language options. (Research: "Japanese users typically have access to comprehensive customer support in their language across most platforms")

- **Taxation and Legal Player Obligations**  
  Research does not explicitly mention taxes but by covering legal and compliance contexts, it indirectly suggests players check local obligations. The Original includes no mention at all of taxes or player responsibilities regarding winnings.

- **Strategic Player Guidance from Research**  
  Research suggests players should understand payout variances and side bet strategies (especially in No Commission mode) to optimize gameplay, while the Original lightly touches on side bets but does not advise on strategic considerations or optimal play guidance. (Research: "For optimal gameplay, Japanese players are advised to consider strategic use of side bets and thorough understanding of payout variances")

In summary, the Original thoroughly covers gameplay, rules, and bet types but omits or underdevelops Japan-specific financial, legal, compliance, security, customer support, and strategic guidance details documented in the Research.
