Conduct comprehensive research to update and expand the review of the "Fireball Roulette" live game show by Evolution for Japanese online casino players with these focus points:

- Confirm the game’s current availability and accessibility for Japanese users, including any Japanese language support and whether payouts and bets can be made in JPY.
- Verify the latest official RTP and volatility figures from Evolution or independent testing labs, noting any recent changes since the April 2025 release.
- Detail the full game mechanics: number of reels/ways/paylines if applicable, bonus features such as Fireball Bonus and Fireball Chaser bet, maximum bet and win limits, and platform compatibility (desktop, mobile, apps).
- Gather statistical benchmarks on hit frequency, win patterns, and observed player returns, citing authoritative data sources or player reports.
- Compare Fireball Roulette to similar Evolution live roulette variants or competitors’ roulette game shows available to Japanese market players, highlighting unique selling points and drawbacks.
- Analyze regulatory and compliance considerations for Japanese users playing Fireball Roulette: licensing status of hosted casinos, Japanese gambling laws impacting live casino games, and any geo-restrictions.
- Investigate user experience factors specific to Japan: streaming quality on common local devices and networks, availability on major Japanese online casinos like Katsuwin, and customer support responsiveness.
- Track recent updates or patches to the game and their impact on gameplay or payout structure, referencing official Evolution or casino operator communications.

Use primarily English-language sources such as Evolution’s official site, major gambling regulators’ publications, reputable industry media, and transparent data aggregators; include authoritative Japanese sources only if official or widely recognized. Avoid marketing-heavy or SEO-centric webpages.
