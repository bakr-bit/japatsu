Core players have access to support for digital wallets and bank transfers that cater to the preferences typical in the Japanese market, enhancing user convenience.

## Game Mechanics

### Layout and Betting Options

Power Up Roulette follows a traditional European roulette layout with modern enhancements. It includes standard roulette betting options, yet distinguishes itself with special features such as Power Up Bonus Spins. These spins introduce additional excitement by offering additional multipliers beyond standard bets.

### Unique Features

The Power Up Bonus Spins are a central feature. For each game round, selected numbers can activate Power Up multipliers, significantly enhancing potential winnings. This feature sets Power Up Roulette apart from traditional variants where such dynamic winning potential is absent.

### Bet Limits, RTP, and Volatility

The game offers a range of betting limits tailored for diverse player budgets. Minimum bets typically start at approximately 100 JPY, while maximum bets can reach up to 200,000 JPY. The game boasts an RTP (Return to Player) of approximately 97.30%, consistent with standard roulette, while its volatility is medium, balancing frequent small wins with occasional larger payouts.

## Bet Amounts and Payout Multipliers

Power Up Roulette’s payout multipliers can go as high as 500x during Power Up rounds, significantly elevating stakes compared to traditional roulette games. Traditional maximum payout multipliers in standard roulette are usually capped at 35x for straight-up bets.
