## Popular Roulette Variants in Japan

Japanese online casino players have access to a variety of roulette games, including classic variants like European, French, and American roulette, alongside innovative versions such as live dealer, multi-wheel, and lightning roulette.

- **European Roulette** is favored for its single zero, resulting in a better player advantage and a house edge of approximately 2.7%.
- **French Roulette** offers similar mechanics to European Roulette but includes additional rules like "La Partage" and "En Prison" that can further reduce the house edge.
- **American Roulette** features a double zero, increasing the house edge to about 5.26%, making it less popular among strategic players.
- **Live Dealer Roulette** and **Multi-Wheel Roulette** provide immersive experiences and diverse betting opportunities.
- **Lightning Roulette** introduces RNG elements to standard gameplay, enhancing potential payouts significantly with multipliers.

## Game Mechanics and Differences

The differences between these variants are notable in mechanics, rules, and potential payouts:

- **European vs. American Roulette**: The addition of a double zero in American roulette impacts the odds and increases the house advantage.
- **French Roulette**: Distinctive rules like "La Partage" return half of an even-money bet if the ball lands on zero, helping players recover losses.
