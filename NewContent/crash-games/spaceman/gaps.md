(Research: "compliance with Japanese gambling laws," "consumer protection and age verification," "cryptocurrency legal framework")

- **Payment Methods Including Japanese Banks and E-wallets**  
  Original omits details on payment options for Japanese players—no mention of bank transfers, Japanese e-wallets, or cryptocurrencies.

(Research: "RTP and volatility level... independent audits")
